  <p class="aboutMeStuff">
    I'm a <a class="core">Front End Engineer</a> residing in Charlotte, North Carolina.  I most recently completed a tweleve week immersion front end engineering program at <a class="core">The Iron Yard - Charlotte</a> during which I utilized <a class="languages">JavaScript</a> and <a class="languages">MVC frameworks</a> to construct web applications.  In addition to <a class="languages">JavaScript</a>,  I have built a solid foundation comprehending and writing <a class="languages">HTML5</a>, <a class="languages">CSS3</a>, and utilizing preprocessors <a class="languages">Sass</a> and <a class="languages">Jade</a>.

    I have a firm stance that core fundamental understanding is paramount. This mindset has allowed me to reach that level of understanding in <a class="languages">JavaScript</a>, which in turn has allowed me to gain access to a more solid understanding of how <a class="languages">MVC frameworks</a> and <a class="languages">JavaScript libraries</a> function and are utilized optimally. I have expereience using <a class="languages">UnderScoreJS</a>, <a class="languages">JQuery</a>, <a class="languages">BackboneJS</a>, and <a class="languages">AngularJS</a>.
